A daily log of changes and commentary. An experiment of sorts.

Improving WStr the same way as Str, while we're in this area.

De-templetizing WStr implementation. Currently it's a subclass
of Vec<WCHAR>.
Yes, duplication of code is bad but so are templates.
Reading code where you see T instead of WCHAR is significantly
worse.
The more stuff there is in .h files, the more code uses
templates, the longer are compilation times.
Templated code must be in .h file. 
While I can't fix long compilation times, I can try to keep
them as fast as possible.
Also an opportunity to make the API smaller.

Optimized str::Str on 64-bit by changing type of len/cap from
size_t to u32.

Optimizing Str. Turns out that after de-templatizing the code
became easier to understand and opportunities for optimizations
turn up.
The optimizations are pretty nasty (re-using the same memory for
more than one purpse) but worth doing for such a fundamental type.
