A daily log of changes and commentary. An experiment of sorts.

De-templetizing WStr implementation. Currently it's a subclass
of Vec<WCHAR>.
Yes, duplication of code is bad but so are templates.
Reading code where you see T instead of WCHAR is significantly
worse.
The more stuff there is in .h files, the more code uses
templates, the longer are compilation times.
Templated code must be in .h file. 
While I can't fix long compilation times, I can try to keep
them as fast as possible.
Also an opportunity to make the API smaller.
