1. if A depends on B, B's direct_dependent_settings is what is added to A.
Useful e.g. to only define include_dirs on B and have it inherited by A.

2. msbuild_toolset seems to be per-project. What that means we can't
have /analyze target alongside with regular targets because /analyze
doesn't work it xp toolset and regular build requires xp toolset.
We'll probably need a separate solution for that.

3. to make the generation solution smaller, maybe put all dependencies
into a single project (instead of 8 or so)

TODO:
* get SumatraPDF to compile
* add dlls
* add installer
* tighten warnings (bump to /w4 and add necessary adjustments to each component)
* figure out /analyze target
* add 64bit (additional configuration or do we need a separate .sln)
